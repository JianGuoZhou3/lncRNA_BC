# README

In this folder are all the data and scripts that were used for the identification of lincRNA as predictive biomarkers. It is divided is 11 sections, in order facilitate the organization of data and results.

Clinical data is provided in \meta and raw data is provided in [\data](https://github.com/LauraMCE/lncRNA_BC/tree/master/Transcriptome/data).

In the other hand, all the scripts are in [\bin](https://github.com/LauraMCE/lncRNA_BC/tree/master/Transcriptome/bin).

Below is indicated in cronological order the complete pipeline
