## Introduction

RNA-Seq is a molecular biology methodology based on next generation sequencing that is use to detect presence and 
quantity of RNA into a sample at a given moment, that is known as Transcriptome (Kukurba, 2015). In clinical research, RNA-Seq is a powerful tool because we can analyze RNA splicing, post-transcriptional modifications, gene fusions, mutations and differentially expressed genes, providing us a broad molecular description and  allowing the identification of new molecular targets for treatment and new biomarkers in prognostic and in the prediction of treatment response (Soneson, 2016).
